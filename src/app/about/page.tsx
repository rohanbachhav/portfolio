      <p>
        I&apos;m Rohan Bachhav, a Master&apos;s student in IT with a strong background in programming and software engineering. I have experience in various programming languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript, and I&apos;m particularly interested in competitive programming and algorithm design.
      </p>
      <p>
        My focus areas include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Competitive programming, with active participation on platforms like Codeforces, Codechef, and Atcoder.</li>
        <li>Game development, especially using p5.js for algorithm visualizers.</li>
        <li>Research in machine learning, NLP, and blockchain technologies.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Currently, I&apos;â€™m diving deeper into C#, and I plan to explore creating my own programming language for fun. I also have a keen interest in building high-performance systems, like an order execution and management system for Deribit Test.
